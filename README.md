Threaded Portscanner in c++
I just remade my Python Portscanner into c++

### Setup
First of all you have to compile the script just open the .sln file with Visual Studio and press run, then the Ide will do the work for you and compiles automaticaly

### Usage
If you run the script you will be asked for a target ip then just hit enter and the Scan will start

### Dependencies
This Script is using a modified version of EasySock(https://github.com/Terraminator/Easy_Sock) and Thread_Pool(https://github.com/Terraminator/Thread_Pool)!
